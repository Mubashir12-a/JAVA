# Student Information Management System

## Overview
The **Student Information Management System** is a Java-based application that allows users to input, store, and retrieve student data. The system supports functionalities for collecting student details, writing the data to a file, displaying current data on the console, and reading the data back from the file.

## Features
- **Input Student Information**: Collects roll number, age, birth year, name, course, address, and contact information from the user.
- **Write to File**: Saves the student information to a file named `Student_Info.txt` with formatted output.
- **Print Current Information**: Displays the entered student information in the console for verification.
- **Read from File**: Reads and prints the contents of `Student_Info.txt` to the console.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following classes:

1. **`Main` Class**: The entry point of the application, responsible for orchestrating the workflow of the program.
2. **`Student_info` Class**: A data model class that holds student attributes.
3. **`Input_Info` Class**: Handles the collection of student information from the user.
4. **`WriteFile` Class**: Manages writing student information to the `Student_Info.txt` file.
5. **`ReaderFile` Class**: Reads and displays the contents of the `Student_Info.txt` file.
6. **`Print_Info_Current` Class**: Prints the current student data to the console.
7. **`Colors` Class** (Optional): Provides color formatting for console output (currently unused).

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher
- **IDE**: Any Java-compatible integrated development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans)
- **Basic knowledge of Java programming**

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone or Download** the project files to your local system.
2. **Compile** the program using:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
3. **Run** the application using:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
4. **Follow the on-screen prompts** to input student data.

## Usage Instructions
- **Enter the number of students** when prompted.
- **Input details for each student**, including roll number, age, birth year, name, course, address, and contact number.
- The program will **write the data to a file** and display the information on the console.
- The **file content** can be read back and printed using the `ReaderFile` class.

## Example
**Sample console input/output**:
```
Enter no.of Student: 2

Enter The Roll Number: 101
Enter The Age : 20
Enter The Birth Year : 2003
Enter The Name : John Doe
Enter The Course : Computer Science
Enter The Address : 123 Main Street
Enter The Contact 10-Digit : 1234567890
```

**Console Output**:
```
Student-1
Student Roll Number : 101
Student Age : 20
Student Birth-Year : 2003
Student Name : John Doe
Student Course : Computer Science
Student Address : 123 Main Street
Student Contact : 1234567890

...
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add data validation and error handling to prevent invalid input.
- Implement the ability to modify or delete student records.
- Add a user interface for a more interactive experience.
- Integrate data encryption for secure file storage.
